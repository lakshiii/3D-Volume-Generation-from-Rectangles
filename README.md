# 3D-Volume-Generation-from-Rectangles
This Python project focuses on generating smooth 3D volumes by interpolating between two 2D rectangles that are placed in different planes. The first rectangle is situated on the x,y plane, while the second rectangle is on the y,z plane. The challenge lies in creating a smooth and visually appealing 3D shape that seamlessly connects these two polygons.
Key Concepts:
•	2D Rectangles: A 2D rectangle is a polygon with four straight sides. In this project, two rectangles are defined on different planes.
•	Interpolation: The project uses an interpolation method to "connect" the two rectangles by forming a smooth 3D shape.
•	Volume Generation: The smooth transition between the 2D shapes results in a 3D volume, which is then visualized and saved in image format.
The program allows flexibility in handling intersection scenarios and perimeter growth control, making it useful for computational geometry and computer graphics applications.

Features
The project includes several features that enhance its flexibility and functionality:
1.	Smooth 3D Volume Generation: Interpolates between two 2D rectangles to create a smooth, continuous 3D volume that smoothly transitions from one shape to the other.
2.	Intersection Control: The user can choose whether the generated volumes are allowed to intersect with one another or not. This gives control over the output geometry.
3.	Perimeter Growth Control: The volume generation process allows users to define minimum and maximum growth for the perimeter of the generated volume, giving more control over the size and shape of the final output.
4.	Visualization and Export: The generated 3D volume is visualized using Python’s matplotlib library, and a .jpg image is saved to disk for use in presentations or further analysis.
5.	Flexible Input: Users can modify the rectangle dimensions, planes, and other parameters to see how different inputs affect the resulting volume.
These features make the project a versatile tool for generating and visualizing complex 3D shapes based on simple 2D polygons.

Options and Parameters
The project allows users to customize the behavior of the volume generation process with the following options:
Intersection Handling:
•	allow_intersection: This parameter controls whether or not the generated volumes can intersect. Setting it to True allows intersection, while setting it to False prevents the volumes from overlapping.
Example:
python
Copy code
allow_intersection = False
Volume Growth Control:
•	min_growth: Defines the minimum allowable perimeter growth for the generated volume. This ensures that the volume does not shrink beyond a certain size.
Example:
python
Copy code
min_growth = 1.0
•	max_growth: Defines the maximum allowable perimeter growth for the generated volume. This ensures the volume does not expand beyond a certain size.
Example:
python
Copy code
max_growth = 5.0
These parameters are adjustable in the main.py file to suit the user’s needs.
